A proof of concept for using the developer menu in the Steam version of the Dying Light 2 game by Techland (tested v1.17.2).

This approach directly uses DevTools to play the main game with a wrapper DLL that applies some memory editing for enabling the developer menu.

The following scripts are provided for easy (un)installation for most Windows-based environments:

- install.bat
- uninstall.bat

Run start_game.bat to start the game.
