A proof of concept for using the developer menu in the Dying Light 2 game by Techland.

Known compatible versions: 1.17.2, 1.17.3

This approach directly uses DevTools to play the main game with a wrapper DLL that applies some memory editing for enabling the developer menu.

A setup program for Steam is included for easy (un)installation for most Windows-based environments.

Otherwise, just copy files from the included "files" directoory into the DevTools bin directory and run dyinglightgame_x64_rwe.exe from the same directory.
