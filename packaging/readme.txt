A proof of concept for using the developer menu in the Steam version of the Dying Light 2 game by Techland (tested v1.17.2).

This approach directly uses DevTools to play the main game with a wrapper DLL that applies some memory editing for enabling the developer menu.

A setup program is included for easy (un)installation for most Windows-based environments.

Otherwise, just copy files from the included "files" directoory into the DevTools bin directory and run dyinglightgame_x64_rwe.exe from the same directory.
